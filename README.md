# Graph and Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) solver

## Project describtion
Given graph G (V, E), the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) refers to finding the cycle that visits all nodes in V, and has the smallest total cost. For this project, the objective is to solve TSP in the practical sense on two example 1000-node graphs posted on canvas given 15 min computation time on a typical personal computer. 

### Table of centents:
1. **1000_euclidianDistance.txt**: graph with nodes represent points on 2-d plane. Edge costs are the Euclidean distance between the
points.
2. **1000_randomDistance.txt**: graph with edge costs are sampled from a uniform probability distribution over the range 0 to 100. 
3. **main.py** the main python solver used to read nodes from the input files, implement the TSP solver and generate the solution cycle for the project.
4. **Solution_922852718_A.txt** the solution for euclidianDistance graph
5. **Solution_922852718_B.txt** the solution for 1000_randomDistance graph 

#### How to Install and Run the Project
