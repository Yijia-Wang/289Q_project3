Given graph G (V, E), the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) refers to finding the cycle that visits all nodes in V, and has the smallest total cost. For this project, the objective is to solve TSP in the practical sense on two example 1000-node graphs posted on canvas given 15 min computation time on a typical personal computer. 

There are two different G (V, E) in the two input txt file.In  1000_euclidianDistance.txt, the nodes represent points on 2-d plane. Edge costs are the Euclidean distance between the points. In 1000_randomDistance.txt, edge costs are sampled from a uniform probability distribution over the range 0 to 100. Main.py is my python function I used to solve the problem. Solution_922852718_A.txt is the solution I get from analysing 1000_euclidianDistance.txt, and Solution_922852718_B.txt is the solution I get from analysing 1000_randomDistance.txt.  Number of cycles evaluated: 9.980010e+05
